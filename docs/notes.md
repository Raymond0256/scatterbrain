# Scatterbrain Developer Notes

## 2021-01-11 18.45.00  

The idea behind scatterbrain is a specialized note taking system to include features like kanban boards, timestamped tagged posts, indexing, and other cool features
while allowing me to work on my project organizational skills before my internship.  
I was a bit taken aback when I realized that GitHub already had a kanban board feature,
but that is what I get for using GitLab all this time.  

After a bit of investigation, the GitHub cards are incredibly rudementary and do not contain the features that I want, such as check lists and individual item due dates and flexible card layouts.  They are basically single box notes until you turn them into issues, which adds some but not all the features that I am looking for.
